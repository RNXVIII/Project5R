# Project 5

<h2><img src="media/homepage.png"></h2>

## A website about a game store website 


# features 

while this project doesnt have alot of features, id like to show what makes this website stand out to the walkthrough project
(while this project does have more features, these features are unaltered from boutique ado so i will not add them.) 

- data models
- custom fixtures 

<h2><img src="media/model.png"></h2>

apart from very minor details this project uses all of its resources from the boutique ado to:
- make sure everything runs and looks correct
- to help with time management 
- to make sure that everything used in this project does not break plagirism rules by using code i do fully understand 



## Features left to impliment

if i hadnt left this so late the features i would of like to implement to make this website stand out more and also what wouldve covered some of the criteria 

- CRUD functionality (in any way)
- any way to sort products 
- the search bar 
- a way to buy products 
- a personalised profile page 
- a way to see stock on products (a value on the data model)
-

# Important

## why is the project like this?

honestly shortest awnser to this was i was lazy after my previous submissions and got lazy , i also thought that the project 5 deadline was on 15/11/24 and not the true 15/10/24 which didnt help

i used all of my time until 13/10/24 trying to get ready for the project 4 resubmission and was told to do as much as i can for project 5 so i have a submission and ever since the 13th (excluding friday , saturday and sundays) i have been using all my time trying to make some sort of project to show ive learned , tried and done work , appologies in advance while this does not excuse my behaviour or change my mark in anyway , its alot easier to understand why this project is so barbones when you know why .


## what am i going to do next 

i am going to continue doing all of the coursework and hopefully be able to give in a much more detailed project in the future

what i would of done if i had more time on the course is i would of followed more of the walkthrough and altered it to my needs to further insure im using all the time as efficently as i can.

## what criteria i havent covered 

i did add a couple things here there that would help with passing the criteria but i thought it be good to highligh it here 

SEO implementation, including:
A robots.txt file
A sitemap.xml file
finish the checkout app 
complete the Profile app
email verification
tests.py

The requirements for an e-commerce business model:

The necessity for the inclusion of an e-commerce business model, highlighting the purpose of the application as either B2B or B2C focused, and detailing the core business intents and marketing strategies for the application.

Implement a custom 404 page.

A custom 404 error page must be implemented for improved overall UX.
Remember to use and implement agile methodologies throughout your project creation.
Ensure you use an agile tool, such as Github projects, to track the tasks involved in creating your project.
Relate tasks to specifically identified user stories.
One or two tasks that cover all user stories will not be assessed as sufficient.

# what happened

 i want to give an appology to the people i promised that this would be done and i dont even have time to fix this READ.MD 

 ## what went wrong

 i spent so much times fixing errors or the way things look it ate up all my time. i started on the 9th (even though it says 13 i had to restart my project due to how lackluster it became so quickly) i honestly dont have an excuse, even i thought i would manage to do this but im afraid not
while there has been significant progress made its still not enough and i just want to appologise to the examiners and also the lovely people down in dublin who gave me a heads up about not being able to get more time, which while fustrating is fair as ive had more than enough time.

speaking of time i did plan using agile tools and planeed this but i still didnt have time 

i hope you still enjoy what ive given you and hopefully i can gain a much better understanding of this.
